    Count all clusters in a structure by finding their local orbit list.

    Note that this requires creating the local_orbit_list_generator object for
    generating the local orbit lists.

    Parameters
    ----------
    structure : Structure object
        supercell of the structure `prim_orbit_list` is based on
    prim_orbit_list : OrbitList object
        orbit list based on a primitive of the input structure
    keep_order_intact: boolean
        count the clusters in the orbit with the same orientation as the
        prototype cluster
