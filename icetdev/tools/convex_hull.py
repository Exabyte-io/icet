class ConvexHull(object):
    '''
    Convex hull of concentration and energies.

    Attributes
    ----------
    dimensions : int
        Number of independent concentrations needed to specify a point in
        concentration space (1 for binaries, 2 for ternaries etc)
    concentrations : NumPy array (N, dimensions)
        Concentration of the N structures on the convex hull.
    energies : NumPy array
        Energy of the N structures on the convex hull.
    structures : list of ints
        Indices of structures that constitute the convex hull (indices are
        defined by the order their concentrations and energies are fed when
        initializing the ConvexHull object).
