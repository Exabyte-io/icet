icet2 &mdash; The tea party for runaways
========================================

This repo represents the next stage in the development of *icet*
&,dash; the pythonic approach to cluster expansions. Eventually, the
code will enable the construction and sampling of cluster expansions
for multi-component systems. Extensive functionality will be provided
to access both high and low-level information concerning, e.g.,
cluster space, cluster vectors, and effective cluster
interactions. The Monte Carlo module will enable sampling in different
thermodynamic ensembles and provide a flexible framework for
extracting thermodynamic averages of various quantities.
