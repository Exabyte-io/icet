# icet &mdash; The Pythonic approach to cluster expansions

`icet` is a Python environment for the construction and sampling of alloy
cluster expansions. It features a Python interface that enables seamless
integration with other Python libraries including for example
[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), or
[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/). Yet, all computationally demanding parts are
written in C++ providing performance while maintaining portability.

A detailed description of the features of `icet` along with background
information and tutorials can be found in the
[user guide](https://materials-modeling.gitlab.io/icet/.test/userguide/index.html).
