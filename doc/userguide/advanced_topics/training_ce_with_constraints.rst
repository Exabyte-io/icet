Training with constraints and weights
=====================================
In some cases, might want to manipulate the linear problem by introducing constraints and/or weights for certain properties or structures. 
In this tutorial, we show how this can be achieved within the :program:`icet` framework. 
We will show how exact constraints can be implemented as well as more flexible weighted constraints. 

A more comprehensive tutorial on using weighted constraints to improve surface segregation energies can be found `here <https://ce-tutorials.materialsmodeling.org/part-2/low-symmetry-ce.html#CE-with-weighted-constraints>`_.
