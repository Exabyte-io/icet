Customizing cluster spaces
==============================
Here, we will show how cluster spaces can be customized to construct better CEs for low symmetry systems by introducing local symmetries. We consider a simple binary surface slab and show how orbits can be merged based on physical intuition to reduce the number of parameters. 

A more comprehensive tutorial on the subject can be found `here <https://ce-tutorials.materialsmodeling.org/part-2/low-symmetry-ce.html#Merged-CE>`_.
