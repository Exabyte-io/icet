Structure generation
********************

This section demonstrates the use of :program:`icet` for generating structures.
The generated structures can be used to construct and test cluster expansions
but also other type of models including, e.g., interatomic potentials.

The scripts and database that are used in the following sections can be downloaded
as a single zip archive. To this end, run the following command from the
command line::

    curl -O https://icet.materialsmodeling.org/advanced_topics.zip
    unzip advanced_topics.zip
