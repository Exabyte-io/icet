Core components
===============

The low-level functions and classes described here are part of the ``hiphive``
core components and not intended to be used *directly* during normal operation.

Clusters and orbits
-------------------

The following functions and classes provide functionality for handling clusters
and the symmetry relations among them.

.. automodule:: get_clusters
   :members:
   :undoc-members:

.. automodule:: get_orbits
   :members:
   :undoc-members:

.. automodule:: cluster_list
   :members:
   :undoc-members:

.. automodule:: orbit
   :members:
   :undoc-members:

.. automodule:: orientation_family
   :members:
   :undoc-members:

.. automodule:: eigentensor_symmetrizer
   :members:

Structures
----------

The following methods and classes are used for handling the relationship
between a primitive cell and supercells that are derived thereof.

.. automodule:: atom_list
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
