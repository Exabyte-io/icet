Monte Carlo simulations
=======================

We are now in a position to carry out a series of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations
to sample the cluster expansion model that was constructed and validated in the
previous steps. To set up the simulation we first construct a supercell and
initialize an associated calculator by combining :ref:`our cluster expansion
model <tutorial_construct_cluster_expansion>` with the supercell.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/basic/5_run_monte_carlo.py
   :start-after: # step 1
   :end-before: # step 2

In this example the sampling will be carried out in the semi-grand canonical
(SGC) ensemble. To this end, we set up a :ref:`SGC ensemble object <sgc>`
object and loop over both temperatures and chemical potential differences.

After a shorter equilibration run, we carry out a longer production run. Prior
the latter we reset the data container (which clears the data collection and
resets the MC trial cycle counter) and the production run has finished the
results are written to file (in the form of a :ref:`DataContainer
<data_container>` object). The latter will be used in the next step to analyze
the runs. Note that the ensemble object is only initialized once for each
temperature. Thereby the configuration evolves gradually and the period needed
for equilibration is shortened.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/basic/5_run_monte_carlo.py
   :start-after: # step 2

On an Intel i7-950 CPU the set up of the calculator takes about 10 seconds,
whereas the Monte Carlo simulation takes about 70 seconds for each data point.
