   BCC
        Several metallic including for example elements from groups 5
        (V, Nb, Ta) and 6 (Cr, Mo, W) have a body-centered cubic (BCC)
        ground state structure.

   CE
   CEs
   	:ref:`Cluster expansion <cluster-expansions>` provide a
   	mapping between a configuration and a property of interest
   	that can be many orders of magnitude faster than the
   	underlying reference calculations from e.g., :term:`DFT`.

   CV
        :ref:`Cross validation (CV) <cross-validation>` is employed to
        evaluated the transferability and accuracy of a :term:`CE`.

   CS
        The :ref:`compressive sensing (CS) <compressive-sensing>`
        technique, which is also known as compressive sampling, is a
        very efficient method for construction :term:`CEs`.

   DFT
        The construction of a :term:`CE` requires reference data from
        a high-level source. Density functional theory (DFT)
        calculations are one of the most common sources for such data.

   ECI
   ECIs
	The parameters of a :term:`CE` are usually referred to as
	:ref:`effective cluster interaction <cluster-expansions>`.

   FCC
        The face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice is one of the most
        common crystal structures for metallic elements including
        e.g., the late transition metals from group 10 (Ni, Pd, Pt)
        and 11 (Cu, Ag, Au).

   LASSO
        The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator is a
        method for performing variable selection and regularization in
        problems in statistics and machine learning. More information
        can be found `on the LASSO Wikipedia entry
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)>`_.

   LOOCV
        The :ref:`leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) score
        <cross-validation>` is a widely adopted measure to quantify
        the basic performance of a :term:`CE`; additional validation
        steps are, however, necessary in order to obtain a truthful
        quantification of the performance of a :term:`CE`.

   MC
        :ref:`Monte Carlo (MC) simulations <monte-carlo-simulations>`
        are an effective method for sampling a multi-dimensional
        space.
