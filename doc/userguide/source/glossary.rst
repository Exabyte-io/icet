   BCC
        Several metallic including for example elements from groups 5
        (V, Nb, Ta) and 6 (Cr, Mo, W) have a body-centered cubic (BCC)
        ground state structure.

   CE
   CEs
   	:ref:`Cluster expansion <cluster-expansions>` provide a
   	mapping between a configuration and a property of interest
   	that can be many orders of magnitude faster than the
   	underlying reference calculations from e.g., :term:`DFT`.

   CV
        `Cross validation (CV) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)>`_
	is employed to evaluated the transferability and accuracy of :term:`CEs`.

   CS
        `Compressive sensing (CS) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_sensing>`_,
        also known as compressive sampling, is a
        very efficient method for construction sparse models [CanWak08]_
	including :term:`CEs` [NelOzoRee13]_.

   DFT
        The construction of a :term:`CE` requires reference data from
        a high-level source. Density functional theory (DFT)
        calculations are one of the most common sources for such data.

   ECI
   ECIs
	The parameters of a :term:`CE` are usually referred to as
	:ref:`effective cluster interaction <cluster-expansions>`.

   FCC
        The face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice is one of the most
        common crystal structures for metallic elements including
        e.g., the late transition metals from group 10 (Ni, Pd, Pt)
        and 11 (Cu, Ag, Au).

   LASSO
        The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator is a
        method for performing variable selection and regularization in
        problems in statistics and machine learning. More information
        can be found `on the LASSO Wikipedia entry
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)>`_.

   LOOCV
        The leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) score
        is one of the most commonly adopted measures for quantifying
        the basic performance of a :term:`CE`.

   MC
        Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are an effective method for
	sampling a multi-dimensional space.
