Overview

In atomic scale materials modeling (alloy) the cluster expansion (CE) technique
is most commonly used for predicting the energy as a function of the
distribution of different elements over lattice sites. Such :term:`CEs` are
usually trained to match as closely as possible a series of first-principles
calculations and subsequently sampled using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, which
enables one to predict alloy phase diagrams.

More generally, :term:`CEs` provide a mapping between a configuration and a
property of interest. The configuration is not restricted to be atomic but
could for example also represent the sequence of amino acids in a proteine
[NelHarZho13]_. Similarly, properties of interest can also be much more general
and include for example migration barriers, lattice constants, or transport
coefficients [AngLinErh16]_.
