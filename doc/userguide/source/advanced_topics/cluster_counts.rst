Cluster counts
===============

A cluster vector is essentially a count of clusters averaged and
aggregated in a compact form. Sometimes it may be of interest to study
the underlying cluster counts rather than the cluster vector. In a
binary alloy with species A and B, for example, one may wonder how
many nearest neighbor pairs are A-A, A-B, and B-B, respectively. To
facilitate such analyses, :program:`icet` provides a cluster counts
module. This example demonstrates how to use this module.

Import modules
--------------

In addition to the :class:`~icet.core.cluster_counts.ClusterCounts`
and :class:`~icet.core.orbit_list.OrbitList` classes, we also use the
`ASE <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase>`_ function :func:`~ase.build.bulk`
to generate a prototype structure.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/advanced_topics/get_cluster_counts.py
   :start-after: # Start import
   :end-before: # End import

Generate prototype cell
-----------------------

The next step is to build a prototype supercell. Here, we create a toy
structure based on Ti and W decorating a simple cubic :math:`2\times1\times1`
cell. Moreover, we define a cutoff for pairs at 5 Ã…. We also keep the
primitive cell, i.e., the :math:`1\times1\times1` simple cubic cell.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/advanced_topics/get_cluster_counts.py
   :start-after: # Start setup
   :end-before: # End setup

Create primitive orbit list
---------------------------

Next, we create an orbit list based on the above primitive structure
and cutoff. To this end, we use the
:class:`~icet.core.orbit_list.OrbitList` class. The orbit list defines
the orbits that are included in the cluster count (every cluster
corresponds to an orbit).

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/advanced_topics/get_cluster_counts.py
   :start-after: # pair clusters within the
   :end-before: # Use the primitive


Count clusters
--------------

We are now ready to create a
:class:`~icet.core.cluster_counts.ClusterCounts` object based on the
orbit list and the above created supercell.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/advanced_topics/get_cluster_counts.py
   :start-after: # Use the primitive
   :end-before: # Print all of

Print cluster counts
--------------------

The cluster counts can conveniently be printed like so:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/advanced_topics/get_cluster_counts.py
   :start-after: # Print all of

The resulting output should be similar to the following::

  Number of atoms: 2
  Found 3 orbits
  ====================== Cluster Counts ======================
  Singlet: [0] [] 0.0000
  Ti  Ti   2
  Ti  W    8

  Pair: [0, 0] [3.0] 1.5000
  W   W    2
  Ti  Ti   2
  Ti  W    2

  Pair: [0, 0] [4.242641] 2.1213
  W   W    2
  Ti   1
  W    1
  ============================================================

The orbits are listed by increasing order (singles, pairs, triplets, ...) and
increasing size. For every orbit, the number of clusters containing a certain
set of species is printed. Note that these are the numbers that would be used
to construct a cluster vector for this particular structure.
