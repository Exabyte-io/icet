Cluster counts
===============

The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how to carry ou a cluster count
analysis.

Import modules
--------------

First, one needs to import the classes :class:`ClusterCounts
<icetdev.cluster_counts.ClusterCounts>` and :class:`Structure
<icetdev.structure.Structure>`, which are used for storing information
regarding cluster counts and structures, respectively, in addition to the
functions :func:`create_orbit_list <icetdev.orbit_list.create_orbit_list>` and
:func:`__get_primitive_structure
<icetdev.permutation_map.__get_primitive_structure>`. In particular, the latter
will be used to generate a primitive structure, for which an orbit list will be
created, using the former. Also, the `ASE <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase>`_
function :func:`ase.build.bulk` is needed to generate the prototype structure.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/get_cluster_count.py
   :start-after: # Start import
   :end-before: # End import

Generate a prototype Ti supercell
---------------------------------

The next step is to build a prototype supercell, in the form of a
:math:`2\times2\times1` BCC cell that is randomly populated with titanium and
tungsten atoms. Moreover, the cutoff for pairs is set to 4 Ã….

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/get_cluster_count.py
   :start-after: # Start setup
   :end-before: # End setup

Create a primitive orbit list
-----------------------------

As will be seen later, the orbit list corresponding to the primitive structure
of the :class:`ASE Atoms` object defined earlier is required for calculating
the cluster counts. More precisely, this is achieved by first calling the
:func:`__get_primitive_structure
<icetdev.permutation_map.__get_primitive_structure>` followed by the
:meth:`Structure.from_atoms` method. Thereafter, the primitive structure thus
obtained is provided as input to :func:`create_orbit_list
<icetdev.orbit_list.create_orbit_list>`, together with the :class:`list` of
cutoff distances for the clusters.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/get_cluster_count.py
   :start-after: # Determine the orbit list
   :end-before: # Use the primitive


Count the clusters
------------------

To count the number of clusters a :class:`ClusterSpace <icetdev.ClusterSpace>`
object is initiated first. Thereafter, a :class:`Structure
<icetdev.structure.Structure>` is generated from the supercell that was
generated above with help of the :meth:`Structure.from_atoms` method. To
calculate the number of clusters, this structure together with the primitive
orbit list that was created in the previous section are given as input
arguments to the :meth:`ClusterSpace.count_clusters` method.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/get_cluster_count.py
   :start-after: # Use the primitive
   :end-before: # Print all of

Print the cluster counts
------------------------

Finally, the cluster counts that were calculated by the previous code block are
printed using the :meth:`ClusterSpace.print` method.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/get_cluster_count.py
   :start-after: # Print all of

The resulting output should be similar to the following::

  number of atoms 4
  Found 3 clusters
  3.43  :: 0 0 1.715
  ==============
  Ti Ti 2
  Ti W 2
  Total: 4

  2.97047  :: 0 0 1.48523
  ==============
  Ti Ti 4
  Ti W 4
  Total: 8

   :: 0 0
  ==============
  Ti 3
  W 1
  Total: 4
