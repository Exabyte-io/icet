Native clusters
===============

The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how to use functionalities, which are built into :program:`iceT`, to extract native clusters.

Import modules
--------------

In the present case it is necessary to import two :program:`iceT` classes, namely :class:`ClusterSpace <icetdev.cluster_space.ClusterSpace>` and :class:`Structure <icetdev.structure.Structure>`. In particular, these objects are used to store information regarding a specific cluster space and structure, respectively. Additionally, the `ASE <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase>`_ function :func:`ase.build.bulk` will be needed to generate the structures.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/get_native_clusters.py
   :start-after: # Import modules
   :end-before: # Create a prototype

.. _generate-prototype-si-cell
Generate prototype Si cell
--------------------------

The next step is to build a prototype, in the form of silicon, bulk, unit cell. It is, in addition, decided that the cluster vectors will be created by populating the sites with either silicon or germanium. Also, the cutoffs for pairs set to 10.0 Ã….

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/get_native_clusters.py
   :start-after: # it with (Si,
   :end-before: # Generate the cluster

.. _initiate-the-cluster-space
Initiate the cluster space
--------------------------

The cluster space is initiated by simpling initiating a :class:`ClusterSpace <icetdev.ClusterSpace>` object and providing the prototype structure, cutoffs and subelements, which were defined :ref:`above <_generate-prototype-si-cell>`, as arguments.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/get_native_clusters.py
   :start-after: # Generate the cluster
   :end-before: # Prepare 2x2x1 supercells

.. _structure-from-si-ge-supercell
Structure from Si/Ge supercell
------------------------------

First a :math:`2\times2\times1`, pure Si, supercell is built and then the sites are randomly populated with Si and Ge atoms. Thereafter, an :program:`iceT` structure is created by providing this :class:`ase.Atoms` object as input to the :meth:`Structure.from_atoms` method.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/get_native_clusters.py
   :start-after: # Prepare 2x2x1 supercells
   :end-before: # Extract and print

Extract the native clusters
---------------------------

The native clusters are extracted with help of the :meth:`ClusterSpace.get_native_clusters` method, with the structure defined in the :ref:`previous section <_structure-from-si-ge-supercell>` as input argument. Afterwards the structure itself and the native clusters are printed in a tabular format, in the latter case by using the :func:`ClusterSpace.print` method.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/get_native_clusters.py
   :start-after: # Extract and print

The (partial) output produced by this script should similar to the following: ::
   Cell:
   [[ 0.     5.43   5.43 ]
    [ 5.43   0.     5.43 ]
    [ 2.715  2.715  0.   ]]

   Element and positions:
    Si  [ 0.  0.  0.]
    Ge  [ 1.3575  1.3575  1.3575]
    Si  [ 2.715  0.     2.715]
    Si  [ 4.0725  1.3575  4.0725]
    Si  [ 0.     2.715  2.715]
    Ge  [ 1.3575  4.0725  4.0725]
    Ge  [ 2.715  2.715  5.43 ]
    Si  [ 4.0725  4.0725  6.7875]
