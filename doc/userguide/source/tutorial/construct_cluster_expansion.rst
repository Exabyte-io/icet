   single: Tutorial; Constructing a cluster expansion

Construction of a cluster expansion
===================================

This exercise is intended to provide an overview of the basic procedure for
constructing a cluster expansion using structures generated :ref:`previously
<tutorial_prepare_reference_data>`. The main objective here is to map out the
miscibility between silver and gold. This means that the property of interest
is the mixing energy. In the end, predicted and target mixing energies are
plotted as a function of the silver concentration.

General preparations
--------------------

A number of `ASE <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase>`_ and :program:`icet`
functions are needed in order to set up and train the cluster expansion.
Specifically, :func:`ase.build.bulk` and :func:`ase.db.connect` are required to
build a primitive structure and import relaxed configurations from the database
that was generated :ref:`previously <tutorial_prepare_reference_data>`. The
:program:`icet` classes :class:`ClusterSpace <cluster_space.ClusterSpace>`,
:class:`StructureContainer <structure_container.StructureContainer>`,
:class:`Optimizer <fitting.Optimizer>` and :class:`ClusterExpansion
<cluster_expansion.ClusterExpansion>` are used, in sequence, during
preparation, compilation and training of the cluster expansion followed by the
extraction of information in the form of predicted energies from the latter. In
the final step, the function :func:`enumeration.enumerate_structures` is
employed to generate a large pool of structures for which the mixing energies
can be calculated with help of the finalized cluster expansion. These data are
plotted using the `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_ library.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/construct_cluster_expansion.py
   :start-after: # import modules
   :end-before: # step 1

Preparation of cluster space
----------------------------

In order to be able to build a cluster expansion, it is first necessary to
create a :class:`ClusterSpace <cluster_space.ClusterSpace>` object based on a prototype structure,
here in the form of a bulk gold unit cell. When initiating the former, one must
also provide cutoffs and a list of elements that should be considered, in this
case gold and silver. Here, the cutoffs are set to 6, 5, and 4 Ã… for pairs,
triplets and quadruplets.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/construct_cluster_expansion.py
   :start-after: # step 1
   :end-before: # step 2

As with many other :program:`icet` objects, it is possible to print core
information in a tabular format by simply calling the :func:`print` function
with the instance of interest as input argument. For the case at hand, the
output should be the following::

  ------------------------- Cluster Space -------------------------
   subelements: Ag Au
   cutoffs: 6.0 5.0 4.0
   number of orbits: 13
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  order |  radius  | multiplicity | index | orbit |    MC vector
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
    1   |   0.0000 |        1     |    0  |    0  |    [0]
    2   |   1.4425 |        6     |    1  |    1  |  [0, 0]
    2   |   2.0400 |        3     |    2  |    2  |  [0, 0]
    2   |   2.4985 |       12     |    3  |    3  |  [0, 0]
    2   |   2.8850 |        6     |    4  |    4  |  [0, 0]
    3   |   1.6657 |        8     |    5  |    5  | [0, 0, 0]
    3   |   1.8869 |       12     |    6  |    6  | [0, 0, 0]
    3   |   2.0168 |       24     |    7  |    7  | [0, 0, 0]
    3   |   2.3021 |       24     |    8  |    8  | [0, 0, 0]
    3   |   2.4967 |       24     |    9  |    9  | [0, 0, 0]
    3   |   2.7099 |       24     |   10  |   10  | [0, 0, 0]
    3   |   2.8850 |        8     |   11  |   11  | [0, 0, 0]
    4   |   1.7667 |        2     |   12  |   12  | [0, 0, 0, 0]
  -----------------------------------------------------------------

Compilation of structure container
----------------------------------

Once a :class:`ClusterSpace <cluster_space.ClusterSpace>` has been prepared,
the next step is to compile a :class:`StructureContainer
<structure_container.StructureContainer>`. The initiation of the latter
requires, in addition to the former, a list of :class:`ASE Atoms` objects as
well as a list of target properties with one item for each structure as input
arguments. Since the property of interest is the mixing energy, we start by
obtaining the energy associated with the (elemental) boundary phases. Once
these reference energies have been obtained, it is possible to loop over all
entries in the database and calculate the mixing energies before adding these
to the list of properties and the :class:`ASE Atoms` object to the list of
structures. Once these lists have been compiled, the :class:`StructureContainer
<structure_container.StructureContainer>` object is ready.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/construct_cluster_expansion.py
   :start-after: # step 2
   :end-before: # step 3

By calling the :func:`print` function with the
:class:`StructureContainer <structure_container.StructureContainer>` as input argument, one obtains the
following result::

  ---------------- Structure Container -----------------
  Total number of structures: 137
  ------------------------------------------------------
  index |           user_tag           | natoms | energy

     1  | None                         |     1  | 0.000
     2  | None                         |     2  | -0.010
     3  | None                         |     2  | -0.011
     4  | None                         |     3  | -0.008
     5  | None                         |     3  | -0.008
     6  | None                         |     3  | -0.009
     7  | None                         |     3  | -0.011
     8  | None                         |     3  | -0.011
     9  | None                         |     3  | -0.010
   ...
   127  | None                         |     6  | -0.010
   128  | None                         |     6  | -0.006
   129  | None                         |     6  | -0.006
   130  | None                         |     6  | -0.009
   131  | None                         |     6  | -0.009
   132  | None                         |     6  | -0.011
   133  | None                         |     6  | -0.012
   134  | None                         |     6  | -0.011
   135  | None                         |     6  | -0.011
   136  | None                         |     6  | -0.007
  ------------------------------------------------------

Training of parameters
----------------------

Since the :class:`StructureContainer <structure_container.StructureContainer>`
object created in the previous section, contains all the information required
for constructing a cluster expansion, the next step is to train the parameters,
i.e. to fit the *effective cluster interactions* (ECIs) using the target data.
More precisely, the goal is to achieve the best possible agreement with set of
training structures, which represent a subset of all the structures in the
:class:`StructureContainer <structure_container.StructureContainer>`. In
practice, this is a two step process that involves the initiation of an
:class:`Optimizer <fitting.Optimizer>` object with the a list of target
properties produced by the :func:`StructureContainer.get_fit_data
<structure_container.StructureContainer.get_fit_data>` method as input
argument.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/construct_cluster_expansion.py
   :start-after: # step 3
   :end-before: # step 4

The training process is started by calling the :func:`Optimizer.train`
method. Once it is finished, the lines below should have been printed::

  ------------------Training-------------------
  Fit Method least-squares, N_params 14
  Train size 102, Test size 35
  Train RMSE  0.00018
  Test  RMSE  0.00022
  --------------------Done---------------------

Now that the solution to the optimization problem has been found, the results
can be displayed by providing the :class:`Optimizer <fitting.Optimizer>` object to the
:func:`print` function, which gives the output shown below::

  fit method             : least-squares
  number of target values : 137
  number of parameters   : 14
  training set size      : 102
  testing set size       : 35

Comparison with target data
---------------------------

At this point, the task of constructing the cluster expansion is almost
complete. In fact, the only step that remains is to tie the parameter values
obtained from the optimization to the cluster space. This is achieved through
the initiation of a :class:`ClusterExpansion
<cluster_expansion.ClusterExpansion>` object with the previously created
:class:`ClusterSpace <cluster_space.ClusterSpace>` instance together with the
list of parameters, available via the :class:`Optimizer.parameters
<fitting.Optimizer.parameters>` attribute, as input arguments. Using this
cluster expansion, it is now possible to predict the properties of any
configuration that is based on a supercell of the primitive structure. A
convenient and illustrative ways of checking the accuracy of this model is to
plot the predicted and target properties for all available structures. First,
however, it is necessary to gather the information required for constructing
such a plot, specifically by, once again, looping over all rows in the
``structures.db`` database and by compiling the silver concentration as well as
the target and predicted mixing energies into a list. Note that the latter of
the three values is calculated by calling the :func:`ClusterExpansion.predict
<cluster_expansion.ClusterExpansion.predict>` method with the :class:`ASE
Atoms` object that represents the present structure as input argument. Once the
list is complete the predicted and target mixing energies are plotted as
functions of the concentration of silver atoms.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/construct_cluster_expansion.py
   :start-after: # step 3
   :end-before: # step 4

Be aware of the fact that the diagram, which is shown below is saved as an
image file, ``mixing-energy- comparison.png``.

.. figure:: ../../../../tutorial/mixing-energy-comparison.png

  Predicted (crosses) and target (open circles) mixing energies versus silver
  concentration for the structures used in the construction of the cluster
  expansion.

Predictions for enumerated structures
-------------------------------------

Since the construction of a cluster expansion is, generally, only the first
part of a study, equivalent to the development of a model, a natural
continuation is to use the latter to predict the property of interest for other
structures, e.g., generated by systematic enumeration.

In principle, the procedure is the same as in the previous section, with the
exception that the structures are not read from a database but rather generated
with help of the :func:`enumeration.enumerate_structures` function,
which requires three input arguments. This includes the :class:`ASE Atoms`
object that represents the primitive structure and the list of
elements, defined above, in addition to a list of sizes.

Also, the thermodynamically relevant convex hull for the predicted
structures can be calculated with the help of a :class:`ConvexHull
<tools.convex_hull.ConvexHull>` object.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/construct_cluster_expansion.py
   :start-after: # step 5
   :end-before: # step 6

The result is a file, ``mixing-energy-predicted.png``, that contains an image
of the following diagram:

.. figure:: ../../../../tutorial/mixing-energy-predicted.png

  Predicted mixing energies versus silver concentration for a set of
  systematically enumerated structures.

Extract structures of special interest
--------------------------------------

Now that the energy has been computed for thousands of structures, it is
interesting to identify the ground state structures. Since even small errors
in the cluster expansion can cause the energetic ordering of the structures to
change, it is advisable to pick out structures that are energetically close to
the convex hull. This can be done with
:func:`ConvexHull.extract_structures_close <tools.convex_hull.ConvexHull.
get_low_energy_structures>`.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/construct_cluster_expansion.py
   :start-after: # step 6

All structures that are within 0.5 meV/atom from the convex hull are now
available and can, for example, be fed into another cluster expansion as their
energy has been calculated.
