    Yields a sequence of enumerated structures. The function generates
    *all* inequivalent structures that are permissible given a certain
    lattice. Using the ``species`` and ``concentration_restrictions``
    keyword arguments it is possible to specify which species are to
    be included on which site and in which concentration range.

    The function is sensitive to the boundary conditions of the input
    structure. An enumeration of, for example, a surface can thus be performed
    by setting ``atoms.pbc = [True, True, False]``.

    The algorithm implemented here was developed by Gus L. W. Hart and
    Rodney W. Forcade in Phys. Rev. B **77**, 224115 (2008)
    [HarFor08]_ and Phys. Rev. B **80**, 014120 (2009) [HarFor09]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    atoms
        primitive structure from which derivative superstructures should be
        generated
    sizes
        number of sites (included in the enumeration)
    species
        species with which to decorate the structure, e.g., ``['Au',
        'Ag']``; see below for more examples
    concentration_restrictions
        allowed concentration range for one or more element in
        species, e.g., ``{'Au': (0, 0.2)}`` will only enumerate structures
        in which the Au content is between 0 and 20 %; here, concentration is
        always defined as the number of atoms of the specified kind divided by
        the number of *all* atoms.
    niggli_reduction
        if True perform a Niggli reduction with spglib for each structure;
        the default is ``True`` if ``atoms`` is periodic in all directions,
        ``False`` otherwise.

    Examples
    --------

    The following code snippet illustrates how to enumerate structures
    with up to 6 atoms in the unit cell for a binary alloy without any
    constraints::

        from ase.build import bulk
        prim = bulk('Ag')
        enumerate_structures(atoms=prim, sizes=range(1, 7),
                             species=['Ag', 'Au'])

    To limit the concentration range to 10 to 40 % Au the code should
    be modified as follows::

        enumerate_structures(atoms=prim, sizes=range(1, 7),
                             species=['Ag', 'Au'],
                             concentration_restrictions={'Au': (0.1, 0.4)})

    Often one would like to consider mixing on only one
    sublattice. This can be achieved as illustrated for a
    Ga(1-x)Al(x)As alloy as follows::

        prim = bulk('GaAs', crystalstructure='zincblende', a=5.65)
        enumerate_structures(atoms=prim, sizes=range(1, 9),
                             species=[['Ga', 'Al'], ['As']])
